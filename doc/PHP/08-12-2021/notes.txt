https://test.seeksolution.in:443/web-app/login
       |                        |       |

uri-segment:each part seperated by / single slash, is called as uri-segment
After port : it is basically path to resource
after protocal and before endpoints (test.seeksolution.in:443) is called
as domain name
Every domain may have a sub-domain or not but will have a port.
and every domain will have a Ip Address, since one cannot learn or remeber
ip address so, we provide a alias name this alias name is called as
domain name and this domain name has to be registred (mapped) with
the Ip and using dns(domain name server)

Question:-
1. http://dev.localhost/myproject/admin/p1.php
http://dev.localhost:80/myproject/admin/p1.php

protocal:http:// or http
domain name : dev.localhost
domain host : 
sub-domain : dev
port : 80
uri-segment : 4
	dev.localhost:80/
