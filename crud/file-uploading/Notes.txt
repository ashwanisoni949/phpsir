File Uploading:-
File uploading does not mean the uploading of the medias to,
database.
it is because the database like mysql, oracle are capable of,
uploading the data, in form of text format

even though if you want to upload the data,(other than text such that)
it has some media related mime type then we may go for,
large text datatype, or BLOB Object.

Note you can upload the Image to the db where large amount of 
data is a constraint like mongodb, S3(simple storage service) bucket(AWS).

In Order to upload the Data in the server using php
1. Make sure your php Allowes file uploading feature
    php.ini check allow_file_uploading : on
    While Uploading data, you can upload max to max 20 files at once
    and each file size can be 8MB post data.
    but if you want you can Increase this limit you can do it by going to php.ini and modifying the setting.
